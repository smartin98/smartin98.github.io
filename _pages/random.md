Outside of work I like to play the fiddle, bake, and get out in the mountains.

## Northern Company (Scottish folk band)
In a past life I played fiddle in a folk band, you can check out our music [here](https://northerncompany.bandcamp.com/).

## Album of the month:
I really, really like listening to music. So here's my attempt to keep track of what catches my ear over time and why (aside from it being pushed at me by the all-seeing Spotify algorithm). We'll see how long I keep this up...
### February 2023
**[Cacti](https://billynomates.bandcamp.com/album/cacti)** by Billy Nomates
I would probably define this as 'alt-indie'. I liked a couple of songs from Billy Nomates' first album (Hippy Elite especially) but this latest one is really on another level in my opinion, it feels more expansive and cinematic in places. Some of this music feels has a slightly unsettling juxtaposition of melancholic lyrics with upbeat backing, thinking specifically of blue bones (deathwish) here. I really can't put my finger what I like so much about this album, but it's awesome.
*If you listen to 1 track, make it:* blue bones (deathwish)
*Track I listen to on repeat:* saboteur forcefield
### January 2023
**[The Overload](https://shop.yardactors.com/*/Music/The-Overload-CD/75771V90000)** by Yard Act
Apparently this is 'post-punk', all I know is it's a really unique sound. The fairly sparse (but groovy) backing really helps to focus the ear on the lyrics and the hard-edged (can't find a better adjective...) vocals. Some of the story-telling in the lyrics is really compelling, especially on the track Tall Poppies... it really captured something intangible about growing up in an English village today.
*If you listen to 1 track, make it:* 100% Endurance
*Track I listen to on repeat:* Tall Poppies
### December 2022
**[Elllegy](https://theolllam.bandcamp.com/album/elllegy)** by The Olllam
Immaculately produced Irish neo-trad (very hard to define the genre for this one!) from my all-time favourite band. Listen out for the irregular time signatures in many of the tracks; I've never heard anyone else make music in 7-time sound so natural and so groovy... having Joe Dart (also of Vulfpeck) on bass certainly helps.
*If you listen to 1 track, make it:* lllow the sun
*Track I listen to on repeat:* a grey eye lllooks back
