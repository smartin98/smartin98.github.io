# Scott Martin
I'm currently a graduate student in the [School of Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, advised by [Georgy Manucharyan](https://deep.ocean.washington.edu/). My research aims to combine approaches from geophysical fluid dynamics and deep learning to better understand the dynamics of mesoscale and submesoscale ocean turbulence. 

Before arriving at the University of Washington in September 2021 I earned an MPhys in Physics from the University of Oxford in June 2021.

Welcome to my website! Have a look around to find out more about the type of work I do.

***Updates:***

* **January 2024** Submitted my 2nd [paper](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5W676) of grad school: we developed new state-of-the-art global SSH maps using deep learning and show that they reveal strong, seasonal eddy interactions that transfer energy upscale and could help drive the seasonal cycle of eddy kinetic energy in the subtropical ocean.
* **May 2023:** Our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003589) on mapping SSH from satellite altimetry and SST observations in the Gulf Stream was accepted in JAMES.
* **April 2023:** Defended my masters, see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dElopCP2_2fv3Fk-bUwskbBnQ8C7HufK/view?usp=sharing) for a recording of my presentation, titled 'Reconstructing surface mesoscale ocean dynamics from sparse satellite observations with deep learning'.
* **December 2022:** Submitted my 1st [paper](https://doi.org/10.31223/X50Q0N) of grad school! ðŸŽ‰ With [Georgy Manucharyan](https://deep.ocean.washington.edu/) and [Patrice Klein](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/jean-patrice-m-patrice-klein), we present a new deep learning method for more accurate sea surface height mapping by combining satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature observations.
* **December 2022:** Completed 1 quarter as a graduate student TA for the class: *OCEAN 285: Physics across oceanography*
* **November 2022:** Gave an invited talk at the IMSI Remote Sensing for Climate Analysis [workshop](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/remote-sensing-for-climate-analysis/) online.
* **November 2022:** Presented my work at the School of Oceanography's Graduate Student Symposium
* **October 2022:** Presented a poster at the Ocean Surface Topography Science Team meeting in Venice, Italy.
* **June 2022:** Gave an invited talk at the SWOT science team meeting online.
* **June 2022:** Presented a poster at the AMS Conference on Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics in Breckenridge, CO, USA.
* **March 2022:** Presented a poster at the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022 online.
* **September 2021:** Started working in Georgy Manucharyan's research group at the University of Washington.
* **August 2021:** [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab2322) on the undergraduate research I did with [Caroline Terquem](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/terquem) studying the interaction between tides and convection inside binary stars published in *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*.
* **June 2021:** Graduated from the University of Oxford ðŸŽ“
